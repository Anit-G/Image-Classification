# Image-Classification

### Cat vs Dog Classification

The aim of this is to create a Deep Learing model and train it on images of cats and dogs. Furthur use Transfer learning model and train it similarly

In order to use this project effectively you need to download the dataset from "https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data"

Also appropriately change the following variables

base_dir\
train_dir\
img1(uses a path that refers to the test images)\
img2(uses a path that refers to the test images)


### KMNIST-Digit-0-1
Use KMNIST Dataset of handwritten digits 0 and 1. Classify using a unregularized Overfitted Fully Connected Network then proceed to regularizer it for improved results 
Use the following link to download the dataset

### Intel Image Classification
Content
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
{'buildings' -> 0,
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }
The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Predict
Created a CNN and used Transfer learning to classify the above
